# Engineering Manager Dashboard Implementation Overview

## Document Purpose
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the phased implementation approach for the Engineering Manager Dashboard as specified in simplified-app-prd.md. Each phase builds upon previous phases with clear dependencies and deliverables.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Data Models & API Foundation
**Duration**: 2 weeks
**Dependencies**: None
**Key Deliverables**:
- TypeScript data model definitions for Linear issues, GitHub PRs, engineers, and teams
- Core API structure with Express/Node.js
- Database schema for caching integration data
- Authentication middleware framework
- Error handling and logging infrastructure
- Base testing framework setup

### Phase 2: Linear Integration & Data Extraction
**Duration**: 2 weeks
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 (data models, API foundation)
**Key Deliverables**:
- Linear OAuth implementation
- Linear GraphQL client wrapper
- Issue data extraction and transformation pipeline
- Sprint/cycle data aggregation
- Engineer assignment mapping
- Webhook handlers for real-time updates
- Linear data caching layer

### Phase 3: GitHub Integration & Correlation Engine
**Duration**: 3 weeks
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 (data models), Phase 2 (Linear data structure)
**Key Deliverables**:
- GitHub OAuth implementation
- GitHub REST/GraphQL client wrapper
- PR and commit data extraction
- Automatic PR-to-Linear-issue correlation engine
- Code activity timeline construction
- Review metrics calculation
- GitHub webhook handlers

### Phase 4: Report Generation & Export System
**Duration**: 2 weeks
**Dependencies**: Phase 2 (Linear data), Phase 3 (GitHub data, correlation)
**Key Deliverables**:
- Report template engine
- Weekly/monthly/quarterly report generators
- Individual engineer report generation
- Team accomplishment aggregation
- Multiple export formats (Markdown, HTML, JSON)
- Email-ready formatting
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality

### Phase 5: Frontend Implementation
**Duration**: 3 weeks
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 (API endpoints), Phase 2-3 (data availability)
**Key Deliverables**:
- React application setup with TypeScript
- Component library (dashboard cards, engineer views, timelines)
- State management implementation
- Real-time data synchronization
- Mobile-responsive design
- Time-based view switching
- Filter and search functionality

### Phase 6: Production Readiness & Optimization
**Duration**: 2 weeks
**Dependencies**: All previous phases
**Key Deliverables**:
- Performance optimization (caching, query optimization)
- Security hardening (rate limiting, input validation)
- Deployment configuration (Docker, environment management)
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Documentation completion
- Load testing and optimization
- Backup and recovery procedures

## Dependency Matrix

| Phase | Depends On | Blocks | Critical Path |
|-------|------------|--------|---------------|
| Phase 1 | None | All other phases | Yes |
| Phase 2 | Phase 1 | Phase 3 (partial), Phase 4 | Yes |
| Phase 3 | Phase 1, Phase 2 (partial) | Phase 4 | Yes |
| Phase 4 | Phase 2, Phase 3 | Phase 5 (reports) | Yes |
| Phase 5 | Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 | Phase 6 (UI testing) | Yes |
| Phase 6 | All phases | None | Yes |

## Technical Stack Summary

**Backend**:
- Node.js with TypeScript
- Express.js for API framework
- PostgreSQL for data persistence
- Redis for caching
- Bull for job queuing

**Frontend**:
- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Query for data fetching
- Recharts for visualizations

**Infrastructure**:
- Docker for containerization
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- AWS/Heroku for hosting

## Risk Mitigation

1. **API Rate Limits**: Implement intelligent caching and batch operations
2. **Data Correlation Accuracy**: Build flexible matching algorithms with manual override
3. **Performance at Scale**: Design for horizontal scaling from the start
4. **OAuth Token Management**: Implement secure token refresh mechanisms
5. **Data Consistency**: Use transaction patterns and eventual consistency where appropriate

## Success Criteria by Phase

**Phase 1**: API responds to health checks, models compile without errors
**Phase 2**: Successfully fetch and store Linear data for a team
**Phase 3**: Accurately correlate 90%+ of PRs to Linear issues
**Phase 4**: Generate a complete weekly report in <10 seconds
**Phase 5**: Dashboard loads in <2 seconds, mobile-responsive
**Phase 6**: Handle 100 concurrent users, 99.9% uptime

## Implementation Notes

Each phase has a detailed technical implementation plan written specifically for AI agent execution. These plans include:
- Exact file structures and paths
- Complete code implementations
- Specific test cases to implement
- Error scenarios to handle
- Performance benchmarks to meet

The implementation follows a test-driven development approach with comprehensive error handling and logging at each step.
