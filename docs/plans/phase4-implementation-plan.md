# Phase 4 Implementation Plan: Report Generation

## Overview
Phase 4 focuses on building a comprehensive report generation feature that allows Engineering Managers to create, customize, and export team activity reports across different time ranges.

## Goals
1. **Create Newsletter/Report Generation UI** - Build frontend interface for generating and viewing reports
2. **Extend Report Capabilities** - Add customizable templates, export formats, and date range selection
3. **Integrate Data Sources** - Connect Linear, GitHub, and potentially Coda data for comprehensive reports
4. **Enable Distribution** - Add export functionality for various formats (PDF, markdown, email)

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Frontend UI Development
- [ ] Create new route/page for report generation (`/reports`)
- [ ] Build report configuration form (date range, report type, filters)
- [ ] Implement report preview component
- [ ] Add export/download functionality

### 2. API Enhancements
- [ ] Extend `/api/newsletter/generate` to accept date ranges
- [ ] Add report template selection capability
- [ ] Implement real GitHub data integration (replacing mocks)
- [ ] Add export format endpoints (PDF, markdown, email HTML)

### 3. Core Features

#### Report Configuration
- Date range selector (custom ranges, presets like "Last Sprint", "Last Month")
- Report type selection (Sprint Summary, Monthly Review, Individual Performance)
- Data source toggles (Linear, GitHub, Coda)
- Team/Project filters

#### Report Templates
1. **Sprint Summary** - What shipped this sprint
2. **Monthly Review** - Monthly accomplishments and metrics
3. **Individual Summaries** - Per-engineer activity reports
4. **Team Newsletter** - Formatted for email distribution

#### Export Options
- PDF download
- Markdown file
- Email-ready HTML
- Copy to clipboard

### 4. Technical Implementation

#### Frontend Components
```
/src/app/reports/
  ├── page.tsx                 # Main reports page
  ├── components/
  │   ├── ReportConfigurator.tsx
  │   ├── ReportPreview.tsx
  │   ├── DateRangeSelector.tsx
  │   └── ExportOptions.tsx
  └── lib/
      └── report-api.ts        # API client functions
```

#### Backend Enhancements
```
/src/api/reports/
  ├── generate.ts      # Extended report generation
  ├── templates.ts     # Report template engine
  └── export.ts        # Export format handlers
```

### 5. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for report generation logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for report workflow
- Visual regression tests for PDF export

## Success Criteria
1. Users can generate reports for any date range
2. Reports include data from Linear and GitHub
3. Export functionality works for all formats
4. Generation takes <10 seconds for monthly reports
5. UI is intuitive and requires no training

## Timeline
- Week 1: Frontend UI structure and basic report view
- Week 2: API enhancements and data integration
- Week 3: Export functionality and templates
- Week 4: Testing, polish, and documentation
